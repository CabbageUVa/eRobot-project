How to use:

1. copy the robot codes to the robot system within the same directory of the emotion library
2. Build this project: https://github.com/Emotiv/community-sdk/tree/master/examples/C%2B%2B/FacialExpressionDemo on your computer. We use a Mac which can install all the Emotiv software easily and the C++ example programs in the community SDK updated recently to support MacOS
